# Let's use 128 char width.
# It is silly to stick to the 80-char rule.
#
#
# Terminologies  <== Read before you got confused
#   - branch type
#     We distinguish the following types of branches: master, develop, feature, release, hotfix, support.
#     We should assume any branch is of one of these types.
#
#   - stream
#     The entire set of branches of the same type. Stream is not branch, it is a set. Stream is not a type, it is a set.
#     Stream is a set of branches.
#
#   - substream
#     A subset of branches in a stream.
#
#   - trunk
#     Trunk is a special branch. A stream can optionally have a trunk, but only one trunk at most. For example, master and
#     develop streams each has a trunk, whereas feature, release, hotfix, and support streams don't.
#     If a stream has a trunk, all branches in the stream normally should diverge from the trunk and later merge to the trunk
#     when the branches are closed.
#     Trunk is a relative concept. A trunk of a stream may be a regular branch of another stream. (The former stream will be
#     a substream of the latter.)
#
#   - source
#     Source is an attribute of stream. The source of a stream refers to the parent stream where branches in the current stream
#     are created from. Most commonly, source of a stream is the stream itself. But this is not always the case, for example,
#     the sources of release and feature streams are the develop stream.
#
#   - destin
#     Destin is another attribute of stream. The destin of a stream refers to the stream(s) where branches in the current
#     stream will merge to. Most commonly, destin of a stream is the stream itself. But this is not always the case, for
#     example, the destin of release is the develop and the master streams.
#
#   - branch name
#     Use this term carefully since it is potentially ambiguious.
#     Try using this term to refer to fullname (see below).
#
#   - fullname
#     Branch name as recognized by the SCM, e.g., feature/enhance_log.
#     Prefer this term to 'branch name'.
#
#   - basename
#     Branch name recognized by flow, but not necessarily by SCM, e.g., enhanced_log (with prefix 'feature/' dropped).
#
#   - name
#     Use this term carefully since it is potentially ambiguious.
#     This term should be a synonym of basename (see above). Try using it only as place holders, such as
#     <hotfix-prefix>/<name>.
#
#   - flow action
#     Refer to action on a specified stream, e.g., hg flow feature start, where 'start' is an action.
#
#   - flow command
#     Refer to other actions than those on a stream, e.g., hg flow unshelve, where 'unshelve' is a command.
#
#   - hg command
#     Refer to command not from flow extension.
#
#   - workflow
#     Refer to the process of executing a sequence of hg commands.
#
#   - history
#     Refer to a sequence of hg commands that has been executed.
#
# Notatioins
#   - <stream>
#     Examples: <feature>, <hotfix>. These denote the corresponding streams. When you refer to a stream, e.g., feature stream,
#     use '<feature>' (or more verbosely 'feature stream'), instead of '<feature> stream', because '<feature>' already means
#     stream.
#
#   - <stream> branch
#     Example: a <feature> branch. This phrase refers a branch in <feature>. Do not use 'a feature branch' to mean a branch in
#     <feature> because the word 'feature' there should take its usual meaning as in English, which doesn't necessarily mean
#     the feature stream.
#
#   - `text`
#     Example, `hg flow feature start <name>`. The text wrapped by the ` (apostrophe) symbols should be a piece of code or
#     shell command, which could contain placeholders to be replaced by actual values.
#
#   - 'text' or "text"
#     Refer to an exact string.

"@terms" : """
Concepts:
- stream
  The entire set of branches of the same type. Stream is not branch, it is a
  set of branches. In general, a stream can contain any number (including zero)
  of branches. The master stream is, however, special in that it contains 1 and
  only 1 branch. The develop stream contains at least one branch.

- basic streams
  Refers to the master, develop, feature, release, hotfix, and support streams
  as predefined in Driessen's model.

- natural streams
  Refers to a set of branches that diverged from and will merge into the same
  branch. The set of branches plus the branch that they diverged from form a
  natural stream. The branch that all the other branches in the same natural
  stream diverged from and will merge into is the trunk of the natural stream.

- trunk
  Trunk is a special branch. A stream can optionally have a trunk, but only one
  trunk at most. For example, master and develop streams each has a trunk,
  whereas feature, release, hotfix, and support streams don't. And all natural
  streams each has a trunk. If a stream has a trunk, all branches in the stream
  normally should diverge from the trunk and later merge to the trunk when they
  are finished.
  Trunk is a relative concept. A trunk of a stream may be a regular branch of
  another stream. (The former stream will be called a substream of the latter.)

- source
  Source is an attribute of stream. The source of a stream refers to the stream
  where branches in the current stream are created from. A stream's source can
  be the stream itself. But this is not always the case, for example,
  the sources of release and feature streams are the develop stream.

- destin
  Destin is another attribute of stream. The destin of a stream refers to the
  stream(s) where branches in the current stream will merge to. A stream's
  destin can be the stream itself. But this is not always the case,
  for example, the destin of release is the develop and the master streams.

- fullname
  Branch name as recognized by the SCM, e.g., feature/enhance_log.

- basename
  Branch name recognized by flow, but not necessarily by SCM, e.g.,
  enhanced_log (with prefix 'feature/' dropped).

- flow action
  Refer to action on a specified stream, e.g., hg flow feature start, where
  'start' is an action.

- flow command
  Commands don't act on a stream, e.g., hg flow unshelve, where 'unshelve'
  is a command.

- hg command
  Refer to commands not from flow extension.

- workflow
  Refer to the process of executing a sequence of hg commands.

- history
  Refer to a sequence of executed hg commands.

Notatioins
- <stream>
  Examples: <feature>, <hotfix>. These denote the corresponding streams. When
  you refer to a stream, e.g., feature stream, use '<feature>' (or more
  verbosely 'feature stream'), instead of '<feature> stream', because
  '<feature>' already means stream.

- <stream> branch
  Example: a <feature> branch. This phrase refers a branch in <feature>. Do not
  use 'a feature branch' to mean a branch in <feature> because the word
  'feature' there should take its usual meaning as in English, which doesn't
  necessarily mean the feature stream.
